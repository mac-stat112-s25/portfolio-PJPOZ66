Use this file to generate a professional looking **trivariate** visualization.  The visualization will not perfect the first time but you are expected to improve on it throughout the semester especially after covering advanced topics such as effective viz.
```{r}
# Import and check out data
education <- read.csv("https://mac-stat.github.io/data/sat.csv")
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
ggplot(education, aes(y = sat, x = salary, color = cut(expend, 3))) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, method = "lm")
```
